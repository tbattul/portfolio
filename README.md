## Work Experience
**Software Developer @ Valuelabs (_April 2022 - July 2023_)**
- Developed Java and Spring Boot microservices within Order Management Systems (OMS) to automate the end- to-end process of yearbook orders for 50,000+ schools.
- Streamlined API development with Spring Boot’s modularity, enhancing scalability and integration.
- Implemented Scheduler using Jenkins to automate technical issues notifications, significantly boosting system efficiency. This strategic deployment of schedulers resulted in a 15% 
  improvement in resolving issues faster.
- Utilized OracleDB to modify and update task specific errors and address data-specific issues reported by over 10,000 end users on day-to-day basis. This process streamlined the     
  validation of downstream calls, ensuring efficient and rapid request-response cycles.
- Monitored logs using Workload Manager to check the flow of the data across different teams and debugging processes.

**Software Development Intern @ Valuelabs (January 2022 - April 2022_)**
- Performed unit testing automation using JUnit and performance testing using JMeter, resulting in a notable code coverage increase of 92%. Developed exceptional work ethics, time management skills, and teamwork, gaining praise and a full-time position.

**Software Intern @ OpenText (November 2021 - January 2022_)**
- Gained hands-on experience in software development, where I learned industry best practices and improved my skills in version control using Git, was also introduced to an Agile environment, enhancing my ability to work efficiently within collaborative, iterative development cycles.

### Microprocessor Architecture/ Cache and Memory Hierarchy Design

Designed a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator in **C++** to evaluate performance, area, and energy efficiency across configurations. Developed L1/L2 cache modules and implemented a prefetcher using Stream Buffers, successfully running over 100,000 read and write operations for performance assessment. Streamlined execution with a Makefile for multi- instance cache interactions.

### Data Science/ COVID-19 Real-Time Data Analysis

Worked on data preprocessing and detailed exploratory data analysis. Merged with enrichment data to understand various correlating features and drafted initial Hypothesis. Implemented Machine learning and statistical models to predict the trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths, which supports initial hypothesis and improved overall F1 by 5% than baseline evaluations. Built a user-friendly dashboard to display results utilizing **Dash framework**.

### Database management/ Wolf Parking Management System

Used **MongoDB** to centralize driver info, permit records, parking availability, and citations. Implemented efficient data processing and reporting for enhanced parking management and violation tracking.
